## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a movie recommender system that leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data and preparing it for modeling. The following steps are performed:
- Removal of duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (if necessary)
- Normalizing numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights. Key steps include:
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations

## Recommender Techniques

This project uses the following recommendation techniques:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based and item-based collaborative filtering to suggest movies based on user ratings.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked based on movie features.

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for rating prediction and precision/recall for recommendation quality. Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness.

## Results

The results section highlights the performance of different recommendation techniques and identifies the best-performing method. Visualizations of recommendations and user interactions are included.

## Conclusions

This section summarizes the key findings, discusses the implications, and suggests potential improvements for future work.
